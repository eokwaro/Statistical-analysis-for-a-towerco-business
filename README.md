# TowerCo Revenue Generation Statistical Analysis

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook files and a PDF report detailing a statistical analysis conducted to identify practical differences in revenue generation within a TowerCo business. The analysis primarily focuses on three key operational groups:

1.  **BTS Site Region:** Investigating how geographical location impacts revenue.
2.  **BTS Maintenance Vendor:** Assessing the influence of different maintenance providers on revenue.
3.  **BTS Site Layout:** Examining the relationship between site configuration and revenue generation.

* **`reports/`** 
    * `Site-Performance-Analysis-Report.pdf`: Comprehensive report summarizing the key findings, methodology, and conclusions of the statistical analysis.

## Methodology

The analysis employed the following statistical techniques:

* **Descriptive analysis:** Power BI Used for descriptive analysis to uncover insights, trends and patterns and enable user interaction with the data through interactive visualizations and dashboards.
* **Parametric ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** Used to identify statistically significant differences in revenue across the different groups (Region, Vendor, Layout).
* **Tukey's HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) Post Hoc Test:** Applied after ANOVA to determine which specific pairs of categories within each group exhibited significant differences in revenue.
* **Regression Analysis:** Conducted to evaluate the key drivers of revenue and quantify the impact of different factors.

## Key Findings (Summarized in the Report)

The `Site-Performance-Analysis-Report.pdf` provides a detailed breakdown of the findings. Key areas explored include:

* Identification of BTS site regions with statistically significant differences in revenue generation.
* Assessment of whether different maintenance vendors have a statistically significant impact on revenue.
* Analysis of how various BTS site layouts correlate with revenue performance.
* Quantification of the key drivers of revenue identified through regression modeling.

2.  **Review the Report:** The `Statistical Analysis Report.pdf` provides a high-level summary of the findings, making it accessible for a quick understanding of the key insights.
